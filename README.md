External Code Formatters for NetBeans
=====================================
(formerly known as Eclipse Java Code Formatter for NetBeans)

What is External Code Formatters Plugin for NetBeans
----------------------------------------------------
This plugin helps you to apply to a common code style in a team of Eclipse,
IntelliJ and NetBeans IDE users. You can use several external code formatters
inside the NetBeans IDE (see below), depending on whatever your co-workers use.
The original formatting engine of Eclipse, the Google Code Formatter, the Spring
Java Formatter and others are embedded and allow you to format the source code
the same way as e.g. your co-workers do with their Eclipse IDE.

The history of this project
---------------------------
*   The original idea is based on [this blog entry](http://epochcoder.blogspot.com/2013/08/import-eclipse-formatter-into-netbeans.html) from [Willie Scholtz](https://github.com/epochcoder)
*   [Geertjan Wielenga](https://github.com/geertjanw) made further investigations on that idea and [put everything together](https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/eclipse_formatter_for_netbeans_ide) to create a first NetBeans Plugin out of this idea
*   This was then [forked](https://github.com/markiewb/eclipsecodeformatter_for_netbeans/) by [Benno Markiewicz](https://github.com/markiewb)
*   [Benno Markiewicz](https://github.com/markiewb) stopped the development on the plugin and so [Geertjan Wielenga](https://github.com/geertjanw) forked it again and was looking for someone who wanted to take it over
*   I think I used this plugin since I use NetBeans, because in every company I was so far, I had exactly this circumstance that the formatting configuration was always there for Eclipse, but not for NetBeans. And because I prefer NetBeans over Eclipse I had to find a way to use NetBeans but the code style configuration from Eclipse. I'm happy that I can give back something to the community now by continuing the development of this plugin.
